            <p class="sub-headline" style="max-width: 800px;">
                For too long, local commerce has been extractive. National conglomerates take up to 50% of every dollar spent in our neighborhoods and ship it far away, leaving behind noisy streets, congested air, and a thinning community. Lofte Eco is the physical internet for the Pacific Northwest. We are a circular, all-electric logistics and service loop designed to keep value exactly where it belongs: in your neighborhood.

            <span class="section-title">The Silent Backbone</span>
            <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto 30px auto;">
                The foundation of Lofte Eco is our specialized fleet of <strong>Chevrolet Silverado EV WT trucks</strong>. Utilizing custom-built accessories and trailers, this 100% electric fleet accomplishes over 95% of our heavy lifting. 
            </p>
            <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
                By leveraging "Pro Power Onboard" technology, our trucks act as mobile power stations. We run high-draw compressors, impact tools, and professional chainsaws directly from the truck battery. No gas generators. No diesel idling. Just silent, high-output performance that proves profit and purpose are the exact same thing.
