            <span class="section-title">The Creator Ecosystem</span>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 40px; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                We empower independent journalists and entertainers. Creators keep 85% of subscription fees and 100% of their own sponsor revenue. But to build a safe neighborhood, we enforce strict, transparent rules.
            </p>
        </div>

        <ul class="rules-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Radical Transparency</strong>
                The first three lines of every video description must state the Creator's Name, Location, and any Financial Sponsors. All corporate sponsors are disclosed by creators, ensuring no hidden agendas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fair Monetization & True Reach</strong>
                We offer tipping options, paid channel subscriptions, and take $0 from your sponsor revenue. We do not use public view counters to gamify content, and we categorically do not shadow ban. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sponsor Matchmaking Platform</strong>
                We don't just let you keep 100% of your sponsor revenue; we actively help you find it. We provide a dedicated connection hub where our creators and eager brands can build profiles, post their goals, and search for the perfect partnership.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Paid Political Placements. No PAC Money.</strong>
                We encourage civic discourse, and politicians are welcome to appear in creator videos. However, creators cannot accept money from politicians or Political Action Committees for appearances or airtime. Furthermore, politicians who operate their own channels on the platform cannot accept PAC money in their current or recent campaigns.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No On-Site Comment Sections</strong>
                We are killing the rage machine. Creators can choose to link a filtered feed from their preferred social platform via a "Join the Conversation" button, or restrict contact to a private "Letter to the Creator" direct message.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Human Moderation & AI Pre-Screening</strong>
                Rule violations are decided by a panel of humans, never AI. However, we provide creators with a programmed AI chatbot to test their transcripts prior to posting, helping them ensure they don't accidentally violate community guidelines. Every official moderation decision is published in a public "Case Law" archive for complete accountability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Neutral Fact-Checking</strong>
                Videos are automatically transcribed and scanned for verifiable topics. We don't tell you what to think; we provide links to 4 independent fact-checking websites so you can decide for yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Algorithms</strong>
                You choose what you watch. Your feed is chronological and based solely on your subscriptions. 
            </li>
        </ul>
